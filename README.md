# Week-1
A deep learning-based approach to classify waste into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).


Tool: Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, web-based interactive development environment (IDE). 
It supports programming languages such as Python, R, and Julia and is widely used in data science, machine learning, and deep learning projects.
Jupyter Notebook provides an interface where users can write code, visualize data, and document their workflows in a single platform. Key features include:

1.Interactive Coding: Execute code cell-by-cell to experiment and iterate.
2.Rich Visualizations: Integrates with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
3.Integration with Machine Learning Frameworks: Works seamlessly with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras for training and deploying models.
4.Documentation: Markdown support allows users to create well-documented workflows.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Models

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized deep learning models primarily used for image recognition and classification tasks.
They excel at capturing spatial and hierarchical patterns in data.

Key Components:
1.Convolutional Layers: Apply filters to input images to extract features like edges, shapes, and textures.
2.Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining the most important information, improving computational efficiency.
3.Fully Connected Layers: Act as a traditional neural network for classification by aggregating extracted features.
4.Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
5.Softmax/Output Layer: Produces class probabilities for final classification.
